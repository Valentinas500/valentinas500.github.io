<h4>Unemployment, Job Search and Stylized Policy Reforms in a Heterogenous Agent OLG Model with Labor Market Frictions</h4>
<p>Download: Working Paper; Two-Page Summary; Presentation; Poster;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Previous overlapping generations models studying the effects of Social Security reforms consider labor supply decisions only on the intensive margin. I, however, analyze the additional labor market channels through which the Social Security reforms affect the economy. I explore these labor market channels by endogenizing the labor market in otherwise typical general equilibrium overlapping generations model and studying what effect the stylized US Social Security reforms may have on the employed, unemployed and retired agents’ behavior and what ramifications their behavior has for the rest of the population. While the results, in general, are in line with models in previous research, the model of this paper suggests a reinforcing feedback effect between (1) capital accumulation and employment, as well as (2) change in the number of unemployed, their search efforts and the number of posted vacancies. These additional labor market channels magnify the long term beneficial outcomes of policies encouraging private saving and labor force participation. The negative long term outcomes of labor force participation and saving disincentivizing policies, such as increased income or capital gains taxation, are also magnified when considering a more dynamic labor market. In addition, the model allows unemployed agents of different ages to compete for job openings and suggests that worker substitutability may be affected by the fiscal reform. In the long run, increased LM participation of older workers may be accompanied by higher employment of the young when private saving increases sufficiently decreasing the interest rate. However, when a reform incentivizes elderly labor market participation but not private saving, it may have a negative effect on the employment of the young.</p>

<h4>Boosting Older Worker Employment. Analysis of Hiring and Wage Subsidies</h4>
<p>Download: Working Paper; Two-Page Summary; Presentation; Poster;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Due to longer expected lifetimes coupled with low median savings, increasing number of elderly Americans will need to work past a typical current retirement age despite facing old age discrimination and various adverse employment shocks such as Covid-19. Among the policies, that could increase firms’ demand of elderly labor, are hiring subsidies for older workers. I examine long-term hiring subsidies absent of any shocks and short-term hiring subsidies following an adverse elderly employment shock in a computable overlapping generations model with labor market frictions.</p>
<p>I find that both the size and the financing of the long-term hiring subsidy matters. A small hiring subsidy increases overall employment despite having a small negative effect on employment of workers below the subsidy protected age. As the hiring subsidy increases, the firm shifts more vacancies towards the old which creates an increasingly distortionary effect on the youth employment causing an aggregate decrease in employment and large welfare losses no matter the financing of the subsidy.</p>
<p>Short-term elderly-targeting hiring subsidy after an adverse shock to elderly employment has a strong positive welfare effect on multiple generations and lead to quicker recovery with relatively little welfare costs.</p>

<h4>Life-Cycle Approach to Informal Work in Europe</h4>
<p>Download: Working Paper; Two-Page Summary; Presentation; Poster;</p>
<p>Presented at The New York State Economic Association 71st Annual Conference (Fall, 2018)<br />
Presented at 2019 Eastern Economic Association (March, 2019)<br />
Presented at the 4th International ESS Conference (April, 2019)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: A non-trivial share of European labor force is employed informally, i.e. without contracts, or engage in informal self-employment. European Commission is aiming to reduce such employment and thus has founded European Platform Tackling Undeclared Work among other initiatives. In this paper, I try to identify ways to reduce informal (undeclared) employment. More specifically, I ask if labor policies such as age-varying hiring subsidies and firing taxes could decrease informal employment? Using European Social Survey (ESS), I find that in most of the European countries and across majority of industries age-informality pattern is U-shaped. Informality, defined as uncontracted work, is high among the very young who are queued for formal jobs and among the old, many of whom face difficulties in the labor market. Inspired by these findings, I set up a life-cycle search and matching model with informal work opportunities. I calibrate the model to United Kingdom, a Western European country with relatively high levels of informality among the old, and then consider how age-varying firing costs and hiring subsidies affect the composition of the informal and formal employment. The simulation of the age-varying policies indicate that firing costs targeting older workers have a negative effect to all age groups because employers consider these costs even when hiring younger workers and share them with workers through lower wages. Hiring subsidies targeting older individuals, on the other hand, increase employment not only of the older but also the of the younger workers by creating an upward pressure on wages which incentivize the formally non-employed to invest more effort into job search instead of choosing informal work. The experiments suggest that besides optimization of unemployment benefits, the goal of informality reduction can be achieved using labor policies that encourage the employment of the older workers assuming non-distortive financing of such policies.</p>
<!-- The size of the shadow or hidden economy in European countries varies from 10 to 30 percent of the GDP. I identify hidden laborers using European Social Survey and show that hidden labor market in European countries exhibits U-shape age profile. I build a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with labor market frictions, hidden labor market and endogenous retirement to re-examine two policy reforms, unemployment insurance and hiring subsidies. The model is able to replicate the formal and undeclared labor market participation rates found in major European countries. Contrary to some previous research, I .find unemployment insurance having a limited effect on the hidden labor market activity as majority of the participants are very young and the very old. Hiring subsidies, however, are able to significantly reduce hidden labor market participation of the elderly significantly improving the well-being of the elderly at a small cost to the younger workers. This paper provides additional support for use of hiring subsidies to encourage elderly labor market participation and well-being in old age. -->
