### Running an Advertising Campaign

<div style="width:150px; height:auto; float: left">
  ![](person5.jpg)
  </div>

Besides differentiation, you can increase the demand for your product by increasing advertising. The effect on sales can be strong. Similarly, if others run strong advertising campaigns, your sales will be negatively affected.

See the table to the right for some ideas about the costs and benefits of advertising.

```{r 5, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

load("advertisingfile.RData")

df33=t(df33)

datatable(df33,options = list(dom = 't', pageLength = 5,
                                          headerCallback = JS("function(thead, data, start, end, display){","  $(thead).remove();","}"))
)

```

<br>

<br>

### Improving the Factory

<div style="width:150px; height:auto; float: left">
  ![](person6.jpg)
</div>
  
Your breakfast cereal is made in a factory. You have two decisions to make regarding the factory: you can increase its size or upgrade its technology, both or neither. 

Increasing the capacity allows you to produce more product. Hoewever, to maintain high factory utilization rates, you may need to adjust your product marketing decisions. If you feel that your factory is too big, you may decrease its size.

Upgrading the technology lowers fixed and variable costs. It may not pay off in the short-term but it will likely pay off in the long-run.

```{r B, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

load("factoryfile.RData")

datatable(t(df11),options = list(dom = 't', pageLength = 5,

### Understanding Credit 

<div style="width:150px; height:auto; float: left">
![](person7.jpg)
</div>
    
Certain investments may require you to borrow. Keep in mind that borrowing comes at a cost: the interest rate you pay on your debt. Interest rate varies but is in the range between 4 and 8 percent.

If you run out of cash during a period, you will use emergency credit lines that charge an interest rate up to 25 percent. While it does not show up separately, a negative cash-on-hand balance indicates you are using your emergency credit lines. And the interest is applied immediately on the negative cash balance further pushing you into the red.

Make your spending decisions wisely to make sure you do not get stuck paying high interest rates. 

```{r 9, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

dfaeq=data.frame(
  Cash.On.Hand=data_all_teams$Cash.On.Hand.Now[Team.ID],
  Long.Term.Credit.Balance=data_all_teams$Outstanding.Loans[Team.ID],
  Long.Term.Interest=c("8%"),

          rownames= TRUE

```

Your banks offers you the following options.
